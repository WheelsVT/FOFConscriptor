<h3>Import Selection Priority</h3>
<p>Use this page to import a priority list from the Draft Utility in
the <a href="http://www.gstelmack.com/UtilitySuite/index.htm">FOF 2007 Utility Suite</a>.
This will be in a .csv file ("DraftOrder.csv" most likely).  When you import this file, your selection list
will be replaced by the order of the players in this file.</p>
