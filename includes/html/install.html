<h2>Welcome to the</h2>
<h1>Front Office Football Conscriptor</h1>
<p>Using this application you can conduct your Amateur Drafts for your MultiPlayer league.</p>
<p>The following screens will help you configure and install your application.  Please be sure that
the following is set up ahead of time:
<ol>
  <li>You must have access to a database server, and have a database already defined.  If you have a hosting provider
    who allows you only one database, you will use that one.  If you are able to have multiple databases, you
    may use an existing one or create one.  The tables created will be "pick", "selection", "player", and "team."
    If your database already has these tables they will be overwritten ... so be careful if you are using an
    existing database.</li>
  <li>This application will write a file into the "includes" directory.  So, the web server must be able to
    write to this directory.  See below to see if this was successful.</li>
</ol>
<p>If successful, you will be prompted to log in using the administrator account.</p>
